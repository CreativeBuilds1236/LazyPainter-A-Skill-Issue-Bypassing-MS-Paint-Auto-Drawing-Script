# LazyPainter: A-Skill-Issue-Bypassing-MS-Paint-Auto-Drawing-Script

Have you ever wanted to draw like Picasso, but you have extensive **skill issues**? Have you ever had the fear of being rejected from art school and accidentally turning into a dictator? 

**Fear not!** Lazy Painter is your all-in-one solution. Why spend decades mastering the brush when you can spend five seconds letting a Python script take your mouse hostage?

## 🧐 What is this?
Lazy Painter is a specialized automation tool designed to "hijack" your mouse and turn MS Paint into a high-fidelity printing press. It converts standard images into a dithered pixel map and physically clicks every single point onto the digital canvas.

## ✨ Features
* **Skill-Issue Neutralizer:** No steady hand? No problem. The bot handles the precision; you just handle the "Upload" button.
* **Stable Pointillism:** Version 2.5 uses discrete clicking logic. Unlike "drag-drawing" which crashes MS Paint, this method is built for stability.
* **Three Levels of "Art":**
    * `Good Enough`: Fast, low-density sketch.
    * `Amazing`: High-detail reconstruction.
    * `Picasso`: Maximum density. Warning: MS Paint will look like it's frozen—it's just in awe of your talent.
* **The Panic Button:** Hold **'ESC'** to immediately regain control of your mouse if the bot goes rogue.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload:** Select any PNG, JPG, or JPEG.
2. **Setup MS Paint:**
    * Open MS Paint and select the **Pencil** tool or the thinnest **Brush**.
    * **CRITICAL:** Set your Zoom level to **100%**. Coordinates will break if zoomed.
3. **The Hand-off:** * Choose your quality.
    * Click **START HIJACKING PAINT**.
    * You have 5 seconds to click inside the white MS Paint canvas.
4. **The Trance:** Do not touch your mouse. If MS Paint says "Not Responding," **let it load.** It is processing inputs faster than the UI can refresh.
